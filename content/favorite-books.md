So you like reading too! Here are some of my favorite books, plus a few words about what makes them special, that I'd recommend everyone to read at some point.

I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.

### Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (And World Piece)

The book that taught me to pause and listen, that life is not a race, and that I can be at ease with myself and my environment. If you want to learn how meditating for even just a few minutes every day can change your life, this book is for you.

### Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life
This book opened my eyes about how important it is to have a purpose in life and to have something to look forward to when you wake up in the morning.

### Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less

If you're looking for a way to refocus on what really matters, whether it's work or private life, this book might be worth a read. It taught me how to "filter" everything out in my everyday life that isn't **essential**. Obviously this can be greatly applied to productivity, but also to happiness in life.

### The Art of Accelerated Learning

We all want to get good a things fast but at the same time we already know that there's usually no shortcut. This book offers some very good techniques to learn things quickly, and most importantly, remember them.
