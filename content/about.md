Hi there.

I'm a Software Engineer and strive to be a decent person every day. I enjoy working on open source and currently I'm on the [Embark](https://embark.status.im) team at [Status](https://status.im), building tools for developers.

Most of my spare-time is spent on either practicing advanced hugging also known as **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu**, [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62899927-pascal) or learning the [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org).


I created [thoughtram](https://thoughtram.io 'thoughtram website'), a software training company that focuses on high-quality content and fun, and [MachineLabs](https://machinelabs.ai 'MachineLabs website'), a developer platform that makes it easy for you to get started with Machine Learning.


You can find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PascalPrecht 'Pascal on Twitter'), [GitHub](https://github.com/PascalPrecht 'Pascal on GitHub'), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531806/pascal-precht?tab=profile 'Pascal on StackOverflow')... pretty much everywhere as **@PascalPrecht**. My profiles and **public key**  are **verified on [keybase](https://keybase.io/pascalprecht)**.

Sometimes, I speak at conferences too. Here are [some of my talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CWifOK_Wi8&list=PLauX9TuJ8sfw6FH2doAbCi5Y-8GJHLqtb 'Pascal\'s talks  on Youtube').
