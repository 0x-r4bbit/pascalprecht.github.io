I'm a Software Engineer. I strive to be a decent person and I like open source.

I created [thoughtram](https://thoughtram.io 'thoughtram website'), a software training company that focuses on high-quality content and fun, and [MachineLabs](https://machinelabs.ai 'MachineLabs website'), a developer platform that makes it easy for you to get started with Machine Learning.

You can find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PascalPrecht 'Pascal on Twitter'), [GitHub](https://github.com/PascalPrecht 'Pascal on GitHub'), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531806/pascal-precht?tab=profile 'Pascal on StackOverflow')... pretty much everywhere as **@PascalPrecht**.

Sometimes I speak at conferences too. Here are [some of my talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CWifOK_Wi8&list=PLauX9TuJ8sfw6FH2doAbCi5Y-8GJHLqtb 'Pascal's talks  on Youtube').

#### Did you know...?

Oh yea, writing takes quite a lot of time, I'm glad you ask. Yes, I do appreciate high-fives on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PascalPrecht 'Pascal on Twitter') and **the tip you want to send to my Ether address below** so I can buy me a coffee or two. üôè
