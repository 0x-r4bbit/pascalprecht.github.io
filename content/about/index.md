Hi there.

I'm a Software Engineer. I strive to be a decent person every day and I enjoy working on open source.

Currently I'm on the [Embark](https://embark.status.im) team at [Status](https://status.im) building tools for developers.

I created [thoughtram](https://thoughtram.io 'thoughtram website'), a software training company that focuses on high-quality content and fun, and [MachineLabs](https://machinelabs.ai 'MachineLabs website'), a developer platform that makes it easy for you to get started with Machine Learning.

You can find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PascalPrecht 'Pascal on Twitter'), [GitHub](https://github.com/PascalPrecht 'Pascal on GitHub'), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1531806/pascal-precht?tab=profile 'Pascal on StackOverflow')... pretty much everywhere as **@PascalPrecht**. All of my profiles and identities including my **public key**  are **verified on [keybase](https://keybase.io/pascalprecht)**.

Sometimes, I speak at conferences too. Here are [some of my talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CWifOK_Wi8&list=PLauX9TuJ8sfw6FH2doAbCi5Y-8GJHLqtb 'Pascal\'s talks  on Youtube').

Come, say hi.
