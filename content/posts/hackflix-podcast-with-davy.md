A few weeks ago my friend [Davy](https://twitter.com/davyengone) invited me to his [Hackflix Podcast](https://twitter.com/hackflix_dev) to talk about my career, how I got into programming in the first place and what I'm doing besides my working hours.

One thing I really like about Hackflix is that Davy and his super professional team try to create a very high quality experience. Check out their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTWlh9Z37_f97y0a0_cjRBw) for more super interesting stories.

Anyways, watch the episode [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaXMMIVZbyc):
