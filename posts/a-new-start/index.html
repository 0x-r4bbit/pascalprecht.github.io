<p>Wait&hellip; what? It&rsquo;s been four years since my last post here on my blog? How did that happen&hellip; ah right, I spent the past years building <a href="https://thoughtram.io" title="thoughtram website">thoughtram</a> with my buddy <a href="https://twitter/cburgdorf" title="Christoph Burgdorf on Twitter">Christoph</a> and taught <a href="https://github.com/orgs/thoughtram/people" title="thoughtram organisation">quite a few</a> people <a href="https://thoughtram.io/git-master-class.html" title="Git Master Class by thoughtram">how to use Git</a> and how to build <a href="https://thoughtram.io/angular-master-class.html" title="Angular Master Class by thoughtram">web applications with Angular</a>.</p>

<p>A lot of things have happened since then. While it was pretty quiet here, I wrote over 60 articles on the <a href="https://blog.thoughtram.io" title="thoughtram Blog">thoughtram blog</a> (some of them you might have read, if you&rsquo;re into Angular). I also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CWifOK_Wi8&amp;list=PLauX9TuJ8sfw6FH2doAbCi5Y-8GJHLqtb" title="Pascal on Youtube">spoke at some conferences</a> and even <a href="https://blog.thoughtram.io/announcements/2015/10/08/pascal-becomes-a-gde.html" title="Pascal becoems a GDE">became a Google Developer Expert</a> for Web Technologies. Obviously there was a lot of travelling involved as well. I stopped counting the countries I&rsquo;ve visited.</p>

<p>Next up, about a year ago, we&rsquo;ve started our next journey with <a href="https://machinelabs.ai" title="MachineLabs">MachineLabs</a> in which we&rsquo;re trying to make it easier for everyone to get started with Machine Learning. In order to achieve greater adoption and keeping things as transparent as possible, we even <a href="https://blog.machinelabs.ai/2018/03/21/machinelabs-goes-open-source/" title="MachineLabs goes open source">open sourced the entire platform</a>. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun to build applications again and it&rsquo;s even more fun to see a community building around the project, with people helping out making it better every day (wanna contribute? üëâüèº<a href="https://github.com/machinelabs/machinelabs" title="MachineLabs on GitHub">this way!</a>)</p>

<p>Man&hellip; that&rsquo;s a lot of stuff. Can&rsquo;t believe all of this happened in the past four years. Anyways, it&rsquo;s time to move on.</p>

<h3 id="i-need-to-stretch-myself">I need to stretch myself</h3>

<p>Teaching people all around the globe software technologies is really fun. In addition to that, you make a lot of new friends which is kind of a nice thing to have as well. I truly appreciate it. After doing this for so many years though, I really feel like challenging myself again and exploring different fields.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why for the past few months, I started reading about the decentralization movement (yes yes, also your favorite blockchain) and related topics, such as peer-to-peer networking and cryptography. Turned out I actually really like cryptography, who would have thought&hellip;ü§î</p>

<p>Similar to what I&rsquo;ve done over at thoughtram, I&rsquo;d like to write about my learnings as I go along. To me, this is very exciting, because I&rsquo;m kind of starting from scratch. I&rsquo;m not the guy who&rsquo;s built this super useful plugin for your favorite framework(<em>cough</em> <a href="https://angular-translate.github.io" title="angular-translate">angular-translate</a> <em>cough</em>), and I&rsquo;m certainly not carrying another GDE badge for being specialized in this field. Nobody really knows me in that space. It may sound weird, but it&rsquo;s a really nice feeling to have.</p>

<p>Just recently I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1415" title="First PR at the js-ipfs project on GitHub">managed to land my first pull request</a> at the <a href="https://ipfs.io/" title="IPFS">IPFS project</a> - thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/Alanshaw" title="Alan Shaw on Twitter">Alan</a>!üôè It&rsquo;s a small step but I&rsquo;m very happy I found a way to get started. You can expect one or the other post about the project and its fundamentals in the upcoming months.</p>

<p>In case you wonder, yes I still like Angular and the community is probably the nicest one that I have ever been part of. Also, as I&rsquo;m maintaining MachineLabs, I&rsquo;m kind of doing Angular more or less on a daily basis. It even looks like <a href="https://ng-be.org/conference-day" title="NG-BE conference">I&rsquo;ll be speaking about Angular</a> at the end of the year as well.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;m going to change my focus a little bit. I don&rsquo;t have any concrete plans nor do I have an idea where this takes me. If the title of this post made you think Pascal is going to announce something big, I&rsquo;m sorry to disappoint you.</p>

<p>Guess it&rsquo;s just time for a new start.</p>
