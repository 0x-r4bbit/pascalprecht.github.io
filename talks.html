  <h1 class="page-title">Talks</h1>

  <p>I speak at conferences and meetups. Well, sometimes at least. And it is fun. Here's what it looks like.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Fireside chats about Angular 2.0  - <a href="https://www.voxxed.com/days-ticino15/">Voxxed Days</a>, Apr 2015</h3>
    <p>In this talk we want to take a seat, set up a very cozy virtual fireplace and have a relaxed chat about Angular 2.0. No migration paths, no comparisons with 1.* versions, just Angular 2.0. We want to take a closer look at how we can actually use the framework by taking its new concepts and features and integrating them into running examples.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>The best Angular yet!  - <a href="https://ng-nl.org">NG-NL</a>, Feb 2015</h3>
    <p>Together with <a href="http://twitter.com/cburgdorf">Christoph Burgdorf</a>, I gonna talk about the best Angular yet at Amsterdam's first Angular conference.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow!" - AngularJS and Web Components - <a href="http://ngeurope.org">ngEurope</a>, Oct 2014</h3>
    <p>The second <strong>ngDuo</strong> talk of all time happened at the first official european Angular conference <a href="http://ng-europe.org">ngEurope</a>. In this talk we showed the people what Web Components are and how they can be integrated with the Angular of today (1.3.x), what issues can occur and how the Angular of tomorrow (2.x) will solve these problems. It was a blast!</p>
