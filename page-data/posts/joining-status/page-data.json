After spending quite some time learning about building decentralized applications on top of blockchain platforms like <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ethereum</a> and contributing to projects like IPFS and <a href=\"https://aragon.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Aragon</a>, Iâ€™m happy Iâ€™ve got the opportunity to join the <a href=\"https://embark.status.im\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Embark</a> team at <a href=\"https://status.im\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Status</a> as a Software Engineer to help pushing this space forward.</p>\n<p>If you havenâ€™t heard about Embark before, itâ€™s a framework and development environment for building and deploying decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform. Embark aims to be as fast, easy to use and flexible as possible by supporting decentralized storage systems like <a href=\"https://ipfs.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IPFS</a> and communication protocols like <a href=\"https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/127/what-is-whisper-and-what-is-it-used-for\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Whisper</a>. Itâ€™s also the go to platform to use when designing and building apps that run inside the Status app and will be a core API for Statusâ€™ upcoming Studio project, an integrated developer environment and education platform for Ethereum developers (sorry, no link, as itâ€™s super early stages ðŸ™ƒ). Have a look at Embarkâ€™s repository <a href=\"https://github.com/embark-framework/embark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™ll be working on implementing new features, creating extensions (for VSCode ðŸ˜Ž), maintaining the codebase and improving the developer experience so that building decentralized applications becomes even more fun.</p>\n<p>In case youâ€™re wondering, <a href=\"https://thoughtram.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">thoughtram</a> isnâ€™t going anywhere. We have great trainers that will continue providing high-quality workshops. In fact, Iâ€™ve stepped back from doing training for a few months now (as mentioned in <a href=\"/posts/a-new-start/\">this post</a>) and itâ€™s working very well. Also, <a href=\"https://machinelabs.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MachineLabs</a> is still open source and awaiting your contributions.</p>\n<p>Working on Embark is going to be a new challenge for me and Iâ€™m looking forward to working with the existing team of super talented engineers, learning more about Ethereum app development and contributing my part to the overall decentralization movement for a better world!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/joining-status","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-09-24T12:46:50.000Z","description":"I'm joining the Embark team at Status.","tags":null,"title":"Joining the Embark Team at Status"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/joining-status"}}}
