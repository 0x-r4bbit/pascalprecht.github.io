It’s been four years since my last post here on my blog? How did that happen… ah right, I spent the past years building <a href=\"https://thoughtram.io\" title=\"thoughtram website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">thoughtram</a> with my buddy <a href=\"https://twitter/cburgdorf\" title=\"Christoph Burgdorf on Twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Christoph</a> and taught <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/thoughtram/people\" title=\"thoughtram organisation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">quite a few</a> people <a href=\"https://thoughtram.io/git-master-class.html\" title=\"Git Master Class by thoughtram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">how to use Git</a> and how to build <a href=\"https://thoughtram.io/angular-master-class.html\" title=\"Angular Master Class by thoughtram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">web applications with Angular</a>.</p>\n<p>A lot of things have happened since then. While it was pretty quiet here, I wrote over 60 articles on the <a href=\"https://blog.thoughtram.io\" title=\"thoughtram Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">thoughtram blog</a> (some of them you might have read, if you’re into Angular). I also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CWifOK_Wi8&#x26;list=PLauX9TuJ8sfw6FH2doAbCi5Y-8GJHLqtb\" title=\"Pascal on Youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">spoke at some conferences</a> and even <a href=\"https://blog.thoughtram.io/announcements/2015/10/08/pascal-becomes-a-gde.html\" title=\"Pascal becomes a GDE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">became a Google Developer Expert</a> for Web Technologies. Obviously there was a lot of travelling involved as well. I stopped counting the countries I’ve visited.</p>\n<p>Next up, about a year ago, we’ve started our next journey with <a href=\"https://machinelabs.ai\" title=\"MachineLabs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MachineLabs</a> in which we’re trying to make it easier for everyone to get started with Machine Learning. In order to achieve greater adoption and keeping things as transparent as possible, we even <a href=\"https://blog.machinelabs.ai/2018/03/21/machinelabs-goes-open-source/\" title=\"MachineLabs goes open source\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">open sourced the entire platform</a>. It’s been a lot of fun to build applications again and it’s even more fun to see a community building around the project, with people helping out making it better every day (wanna contribute? 👉🏼<a href=\"https://github.com/machinelabs/machinelabs\" title=\"MachineLabs on GitHub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this way!</a>)</p>\n<p>Man… that’s a lot of stuff. Can’t believe all of this happened in the past four years. Anyways, it’s time to move on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-need-to-stretch-myself\"><a href=\"#i-need-to-stretch-myself\" aria-label=\"i need to stretch myself permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I need to stretch myself</h3>\n<p>Teaching people all around the globe software technologies is really fun. In addition to that, you make a lot of new friends which is kind of a nice thing to have as well. I truly appreciate it. After doing this for so many years though, I really feel like challenging myself again and exploring different fields.</p>\n<p>That’s why for the past few months, I started reading about the decentralization movement (yes yes, also your favorite blockchain) and related topics, such as peer-to-peer networking and cryptography. Turned out I actually really like cryptography, who would have thought…🤔</p>\n<p>Similar to what I’ve done over at thoughtram, I’d like to write about my learnings as I go along. To me, this is very exciting, because I’m kind of starting from scratch. I’m not the guy who’s built this super useful plugin for your favorite framework (<em>cough</em> <a href=\"https://angular-translate.github.io\" title=\"angular-translate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">angular-translate</a> <em>cough</em>), and I’m certainly not carrying another GDE badge for being specialized in this field. Nobody really knows me in that space. It may sound weird, but it’s a really nice feeling to have.</p>\n<p>Just recently I’ve <a href=\"https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1415\" title=\"First PR at the js-ipfs project on GitHub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">managed to land my first pull request</a> at the <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/\" title=\"IPFS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IPFS project</a> - thanks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alanshaw\" title=\"Alan Shaw on Twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Alan</a>!🙏 It’s a small step but I’m very happy I found a way to get started. You can expect one or the other post about the project and its fundamentals in the upcoming months.</p>\n<p>In case you wonder, yes I still like Angular and the community is probably the nicest one that I have ever been part of. Also, as I’m maintaining MachineLabs, I’m kind of doing Angular more or less on a daily basis. It even looks like <a href=\"https://ng-be.org/conference-day\" title=\"NG-BE conference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">I’ll be speaking about Angular</a> at the end of the year as well.</p>\n<p>However, I’m going to change my focus a little bit. I don’t have any concrete plans nor do I have an idea where this takes me. If the title of this post made you think Pascal is going to announce something big, I’m sorry to disappoint you.</p>\n<p>Guess it’s just time for a new start.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/a-new-start","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-07-09T08:51:44+02:00","description":"Some thoughts on leaving the comfort zone.","tags":null,"title":"Guess it's time for a new start"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/a-new-start"}}}
