The primary goal was to create a side product that would complement our Git Master Class. A nice guide that we could hand out to our students once they‚Äôve finished the class, as well as selling it to generate some passive revenue.</p>\n<p>However, shortly after we kicked off this whole <a href=\"https://thoughtram.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">thoughtram</a> thing, we‚Äôve also started offering <a href=\"https://thoughtram.io/angular-master-class.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">on-site classes about Angular</a>, which then kept us busy pretty much full-time as we got hundreds of training requests. The result of that was that we managed to write maybe one and a half chapters and didn‚Äôt get to continue working on the book anymore.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward, about five years later, I decided to bring REBASE back to life in a different style, different tone and different experience. I also really just felt like creating a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù from scratch and getting a bit creative with the design, its website and everything else that comes with it.</p>\n<p>And so it starts‚Ä¶</p>\n<h2 id=\"reevaluating-the-idea-and-getting-feedback\"><a href=\"#reevaluating-the-idea-and-getting-feedback\" aria-label=\"reevaluating the idea and getting feedback permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reevaluating the idea and getting feedback</h2>\n<p>Whenever it comes building or creating something new, whether it is a product, a software project, or even a company, I really believe in making small steps and taking things one step at a time. So instead of going all-in, buying a new domain, hiring a designer to create a website and setting up paid ads and marketing, I first wanted to make sure if there‚Äôs actual interest in a book like REBASE.</p>\n<p>Luckily, these days it‚Äôs extremely easy to gather feedback on various social platforms from friends and followers, especially with functionalities like built-in polls on Twitter. Due to my follower base on Twitter (13k+ at the time of writing this article), I tend to reach at least <strong>some</strong> people when it comes to putting out a poll. Certainly, the number of responses is in no way representative of the entire potential target audience, but it‚Äôs still better than nothing.</p>\n<p>So I decided to create a poll in which I‚Äôd ask how much people would be willing to spend on a book like REBASE:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How much are you willing to spend on a book with hand-drawn illustrations, that teaches you how to be super productive with Git, with a big focus on rebasing and understanding the tool without wasting your time?</p>&mdash; Pascal Precht (@PascalPrecht) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PascalPrecht/status/1200389992184463361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 29, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<p>What‚Äôs interesting to note is that, while the majority of voters voted for the smallest amount of money out of all the available options, there were some replies to this tweet in which people said they‚Äôd pay more than the biggest amount available in those options.</p>\n<p>Overall I was quite happy with the outcome of the poll and decided to give this project a go.</p>\n<h2 id=\"announcing-the-pre-sale-launch\"><a href=\"#announcing-the-pre-sale-launch\" aria-label=\"announcing the pre sale launch permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Announcing the Pre-sale Launch</h2>\n<p>Yes, that‚Äôs right. Time for the first launch. After I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôll give REBASE a spin, I also wanted to make sure that I get things going as quickly as possible. It was important for me that I don‚Äôt spend months and months, or even years, on writing the book and never release a first version.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs why I decided to set a rather aggressive deadline and make it public so I have a certain amount of pressure to actually deliver the thing. The goal was to release a first version of the book within two months. It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect, but it should be ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù in the sense that the main content of the book is covered and readable.</p>\n<p>As I‚Äôve mentioned earlier, I believe in starting small and improve iteratively, so I went ahead and created a <a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/rebase-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">product page on Gumroad</a> that can already be used to sell the product, even though it doesn‚Äôt exist yet. I also didn‚Äôt have any media graphics or illustrations yet, so I‚Äôve scribbled something that could one day be the REBASE title page:</p>\n<img alt=\"REBASE logo draft\" src=\"/media/rebase-logo-draft.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 600px\">\n<p>With a total ‚ÄúMVP‚Äù in place (to be fair, not really an MVP because there was no product yet), I‚Äôve announced the pre-sale of the book on Twitter and was hoping that maybe a handful of people would preorder it. To increase the incentive, I decided to sell the book for 15,00 ‚Ç¨ excluding VAT during the pre-sale phase, as opposed to 20,00 ‚Ç¨ for the launch release.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m resurrecting a book idea <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cburgdorf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@cburgdorf</a> and I planned to write about 5 years ago.<br><br>&quot;REBASE&quot; will teach you the ins and outs of rebasing in Git to take your productivity to the next level.<br><br>You can pre-order it now.

There are certainly many different tools and apps to write books these days. For me it was important though, that I can start quickly and move quickly. I don‚Äôt want to spend too much time clicking around, importing and exporting files, aligning graphics etc. Ideally, I would find a way to write the book in plain old markdown and then have some tools or script to generate proper ebook reader friendly format from that.</p>\n<p>And that‚Äôs exactly what I ended up doing. I decided to go with <a href=\"https://pandoc.org/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">pandoc</a>, a universal document converter. It‚Äôs extremely flexible and comes with a markdown-to-epub converter built-in! Epub is the format used by Apple iBooks. I still needed a way to generate Mobi files, which is the format used by Amazon Kindle. Luckily, there‚Äôs another tool called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">kindlegen</a> from Amazon which takes an ePub file as input and generates a Mobi file from that!</p>\n<p>Having those tools and hand, all I had to do was creating a little script that automates the process of generating the ebook reader files. I kept fine-tuning the script a little bit here and there over time, but this is what it looks like in a nutshell:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">rm -rf output/*\n\npandoc \\\n  --pdf-engine=xelatex \\\n  -o output/rebase.pdf \\\n  source/chapters/foreword.md \\\n  source/chapters/introduction.md \\\n  source/chapters/a-quick-look-behind-the-scenes.md \\\n  source/chapters/anatomy-of-a-git-commit.md \\\n  source/chapters/a-branch-is-just-a-pointer.md \\\n  source/chapters/merge-strategies.md \\\n  source/chapters/a-quick-detour-on-reset.md \\\n  source/chapters/rebasing.md \\\n  source/chapters/interactive-rebasing.md \\\n  source/chapters/cherry-picking.md \\\n  source/chapters/appendix-a.md \\\n  source/chapters/appendix-b.md \\\n  source/chapters/appendix-c.md \\\n  source/chapters/thank-you.md \\\n  --toc\n\npandoc \\\n  -o output/rebase.epub \\\n  source/meta \\\n  source/chapters/foreword.md \\\n  source/chapters/introduction.md \\\n  source/chapters/a-quick-look-behind-the-scenes.md \\\n  source/chapters/anatomy-of-a-git-commit.md \\\n  source/chapters/a-branch-is-just-a-pointer.md \\\n  source/chapters/merge-strategies.md \\\n  source/chapters/a-quick-detour-on-reset.md \\\n  source/chapters/rebasing.md \\\n  source/chapters/interactive-rebasing.md \\\n  source/chapters/cherry-picking.md \\\n  source/chapters/appendix-a.md \\\n  source/chapters/appendix-b.md \\\n  source/chapters/appendix-c.md \\\n  source/chapters/thank-you.md \\\n  --toc\n\nkindlegen output/rebase.epub -o rebase.mobi</code></pre></div>\n<p>Testing the REBASE was then just a matter of running the script and drag and dropping the files into their dedicated programs, such as Amazon Kindle and Apple iBooks. For mobile testing I used Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúSend to Kindle‚Äù feature. It‚Äôs pretty cool because it lets you easily send any book to your Kindle device via your Kindle email address.</p>\n<p>Having this super minimal writing workflow figured out, I was ready to put the pen on paper!</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-a-domain-and-reaching-the-first-milestone\"><a href=\"#getting-a-domain-and-reaching-the-first-milestone\" aria-label=\"getting a domain and reaching the first milestone permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Getting a domain and reaching the first milestone</h2>\n<p>I decided to create an <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/product/rebase-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IndieHackers page for REBASE</a> to have a place to keep track of weekly milestones. I know, milestones probably shouldn‚Äôt be measured on a timely basis, but since the deadline for a first release was just two months away, I thought it‚Äôd be okay to keep everyone about the progress in the loop via milestones.</p>\n<p>Exactly one week after the pre-sale has started, <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/product/rebase-book/30-sold-copies--Lvr5R-MkTJ4VQ1hGaU7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">I‚Äôve sold 30 copies</a> and generated a gross revenue of about $500.</p>\n<img alt=\"First Gumroad Stats showing 30 sold copies of REBASE\" src=\"/media/gumroad-stats-1.png\" style=\"max-width: 600px\">\n<p>Now was a time where I felt comfortable reinvesting into the project and actually spend a bit of money to take it to the next level.

Given that I used to do a lot of front-end development and therefore know how websites are made, I sat down and built a simple landing page from scratch instead, with the goal to launch it the next day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"launching-a-first-landing-page\"><a href=\"#launching-a-first-landing-page\" aria-label=\"launching a first landing page permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Launching a first landing page</h2>\n<p>I certainly wanted to have a nice and crisp looking landing page, but I also knew that I coudldn‚Äôt spend too much time and energy on being a perfectionist and coming up with an outstanding design and layout. In addition, I also didn‚Äôt feel like putting too much effort into static site generators or any of the various ‚Äústarter kits‚Äù to build a simple one-pager landing page.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I found this cool open source repository called <a href=\"https://github.com/nqthqn/one-page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">one-page</a>, which is literally just a single HTML file template but comes with a modern CSS pipeline to make use of preprocessors such as SASS. Exactly what I needed!</p>\n<p>After a few hours of fiddling around with some HTML, CSS and setting up the domain correctly, I was happy to create <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/product/rebase-book/official-landing-page-launch--Lvr6lGNk9azgxkYUw-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">another milestone</a> and launch a first version of the landing page.

It‚Äôs awesome because it takes care of the entire checkout flow, without interferring with the rest of your website.</li>\n<li>There were certainly plenty typos in the copy, however, I guess the over all message and structure is clear. It was important for me to be as transparent about the book‚Äôs content as possible, without giving too much away. As a matter of fact, I wasn‚Äôt even entirely sure what the exact chapters are going to be because I‚Äôve just written the first chapter.</li>\n<li>The launch of <strong>the landing page caused another 5 sales</strong> that day, increasing the total amount of sold copies to 35.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also took the chance to create <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/post/im-writing-a-book-about-git-in-two-months-30dda144d0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">a post</a> in one of the IndieHackers forums to ask for feebdack from the community.

There was no way I could launch and announce a landing page without having at least a title cover for people to look at. So once again, I put on my ‚Äústart-less-and-do-more‚Äù-hat and created a book cover in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Google Drawings</a> based on a scribble I‚Äôve created at the time when I was sketching out the title as well.</p>\n<p>This is what the scribble looks like:</p>\n<img alt=\"First scribble of REBASE cover illustration\" src=\"/media/rebase-graph-draft.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 600px\">\n<p>And the final book cover:</p>\n<img alt=\"REBASE book cover\" src=\"/media/rebase-cover.png\" style=\"max-width: 600px\">\n<p>One thing I haven‚Äôt mentioned, was that I wanted to create custom illustrations for the book. Eventually, I ended up drawing all illustrations for the book in Google Drawings myself. No designer or illustrator involved. Which means, zero additional costs!</p>\n<h2 id=\"setting-up-an-email-workflow\"><a href=\"#setting-up-an-email-workflow\" aria-label=\"setting up an email workflow permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Setting up an email workflow</h2>\n<p>Okay, so this may sound a little bit rude, but I think as a solo hacker or entepreneur it‚Äôs always good to aim for optimizing yourself out of the product as much as you can. What I mean by that, is simply that things that can be automated, should be automated. This is especially true for email workflows, which should help improving the product you‚Äôre working on by getting user feedback and engagement.</p>\n<p>For example, every time someone buys a copy of REBASE, I would like to do a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expressing my gratitude for supporting my work (sounds cheesy I know, but I really mean it).</li>\n<li>Asking how they learned about REBASE. This is super important because I want to get an idea which channels work well to get the word out about the book.</li>\n<li>Letting them know that they can follow regular updates on the Indie Hackers page.</li>\n<li>Potentially have <strong>them</strong> share the fact that they bought the book, so their circle will learn about it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I really believe in reaching out to customer personally, also as a way to express that I care, however, once you have to do these things above for 50+ people, it actually takes quite a lot of time, even when the email is already prepared as a template.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs why for this task, I set up an email workflow with Gumroad. It lets me configure multiple emails that will be send out to my customers after certain events have happened and a certain time has expired. For example, one hour after a purchase, I send an email with the content discussed above. About one week later however, I reach out to the reader again to ask whether they‚Äôve finished the book and what they found most valuable. I also ask them what‚Äôs the one thing they are missing the most.</p>\n<p>Setting up this email workflow turned out to be super valuable as I‚Äôm getting high-quality feedback from my readers and it helps me a lot to improve the product.</p>\n<h2 id=\"constant-progress-every-day-a-little-bit\"><a href=\"#constant-progress-every-day-a-little-bit\" aria-label=\"constant progress every day a little bit permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Constant progress. Every day a little bit.</h2>\n<p>Writing an entire book in just two months is certainly an ambitious goal, however as I‚Äôve mentioned earlier, I was not aiming for a perfect masterpiece. Also, knowing about the things you want to write about helps a lot as well. I didn‚Äôt need to do too much research.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs what I thought: I have about 8 weeks. Let me try to write one chapter every week. That would be 8 chapters and should be plenty for the book (spoiler: I ended up squeezing in a 9th chapter later on). To make sure I stay on track, <strong>I made it a habit to write 1-2 hours every day</strong> in the evening after work. Well, to be fair, more often than not is was more like every second evening, because I still went to my BJJ classes 3-4 times a week.</p>\n<p>Anyways, the point is that doing a little bit roughly every day really helped me having a clear understanding of whether I‚Äôm behind or on time, while making constant progress. This was probably one of the most crucial actions I‚Äôve taken in this whole project.</p>\n<p>Of course, I also didn‚Äôt stop improving the landing page to make it more attractive to potential readers of the book. <strong>Here are a few things I‚Äôve learned</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High-contrast CTAs</strong> - Call-To-Action buttons should have a high contrast so they are easily spotted.</li>\n<li><strong>Supportive CTA information</strong> - It can have a very positive effect to add some supportive information close to the CTA. This can be messages like ‚Äù<em>You won‚Äôt be charged until the release</em>‚Äù, or ‚Äù<em>Only three items left!</em>‚Äú.</li>\n<li><strong>Trigger emotions</strong> - Your landing page‚Äôs copy can have a massive impact when it‚Äôs written in a way that it speaks to the reader. This is often done by address certain pain points that the reader identifies with.</li>\n<li><strong>Visible price and discount</strong> - If you put a price close to the CTA and it will be clicked, you know the user is most likely willing to pay that amount for your product. I played around with <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/post/discount-in-buy-button-d390349e71\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">putting the discount in the button</a> as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few more iterations later, the landing page has converted <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/product/rebase-book/50-sold-copies--Lwcbbo9DQKu0KsaWF4e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">50 sold copies</a>. Once again, the Indie Hackers community has given a lot of very valuable feedback.</p>\n<p>Probably the most impactful change on the page is the <strong>‚ÄúThis book is for you if‚Ä¶‚Äù</strong> section. I‚Äôve received a lot of feedback that this very section caused a lot of users to hit the buy button.</p>\n<p>Again, triggering emotions is a very powerful tool!</p>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot showing the section of the website\" src=\"/media/book-is-for-u.png\" style=\"max-width: 600px\">\n<p>Every time I did a significant change to the landing page, I posted an update at Indie Hackers and on Twitter. Even though I didn‚Äôt have too many visitors, the conversion rate was pretty decent from the get got, so it wouldn‚Äôt take too long until I‚Äôd reach my first major milestone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"making-the-first-1000-\"><a href=\"#making-the-first-1000-\" aria-label=\"making the first 1000  permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Making the first $1000 üéâ</h2>\n<p>About four weeks into the project, pretty much exactly during christmas, I was happy to see that <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/product/rebase-book/1000-gross-revenue--Lx12v6dyAzyPkSDjP3q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">I‚Äôve sold 62 copies and hit the $1000 mark in gross revenue</a>. That was for sure an amazing christmas gift!</p>\n<img alt=\"First Gumroad Stats showing 62 sold copies of REBASE\" src=\"/media/gumroad-stats-2.png\" style=\"max-width: 600px\">\n<p>At this point I had written about half the book. I also had a better idea of what the exact outline is going to be, so I‚Äôve added a chapter breakdown it to the landing page. Overall, <a href=\"https://rebase-book.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">rebase-book.com</a> was performing really well. Its overall <strong>conversion rate was 5.1%</strong> according to Gumroad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"generating-traffic-through-regular-updates\"><a href=\"#generating-traffic-through-regular-updates\" aria-label=\"generating traffic through regular updates permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Generating traffic through regular updates</h2>\n<p>Once I‚Äôve reached the $1000 milestone, I saw more and more activity and engagement in the Indie Hackers community. There was one question that kept coming up. A lot of people were interested in how I‚Äôm marketing REBASE, what‚Äôs my main traffic channel, whether I‚Äôm using paid ads, how big my mailing list was (spoiler: I don‚Äôt even have one for REBASE) etc.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve responded to all questions in <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/product/rebase-book/200-sold-copies--M-4Keh0hRvgsbIGFXrA?commentId=-M-9KtZj3naeLQFs25-d&#x26;utm_campaign=forum-notification&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_source=indie-hackers-emails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">various comments</a>, but here‚Äôs what it boils down to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clearly, the biggest impact in terms of marketing is my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pascalprecht\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter channel</a> with over 13k followers (at the time of writing this article). This has been confirmed by many reponses I‚Äôve got from the <a href=\"#setting-up-an-email-workflow\">email workflow</a>. Most of my followers know me from my past activities in the JavaScript community, conference talks, blog posts and onsite workshops and therefore know what kind of teaching style they can expect. This has lead to many sales. <strong>I guess it‚Äôs important to have or build an audience first</strong>.</li>\n<li>You want to get the word out there without coming across too spammy. So instead of just retweeting the fact that I‚Äôm working on a book, I mostly tweeted about it together with some progress update. Whether it‚Äôs a new finished chapter, or an update to the landing page with more useful information. Have something new to share, otherwise you‚Äôll get muted.</li>\n<li>The weekly milestones on IndieHackers have helped a lot too. Once a milestone has 2-3 upvotes, it actually shows up on Indie Hacker‚Äôs frontpage, exposing your product to many people. Having a lot of people commenting and discussing about your work increases the votes as well and causes more people to run into your product.</li>\n<li>I didn‚Äôt do any paid ads. The only ‚Äúad‚Äù that I‚Äôve set up was a banner in the blog post view of <a href=\"https://blog.thoughtram.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">my company‚Äôs blog</a>. The blog has 100k page views per month on average and I could see a good amount of that ending up on <a href=\"https://rebase-book.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">rebase-book.com</a> because of that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So all in all I guess it‚Äôs save to say that regular, meaningful updates are key to generating a decent amount of traffic. Having that traffic convert, is then job of the landing page. As you know by now, that‚Äôs something I kept fine-tuning day in and day out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-sales-milestones-and-a-10-conversion-rate\"><a href=\"#more-sales-milestones-and-a-10-conversion-rate\" aria-label=\"more sales milestones and a 10 conversion rate permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>More sales, milestones and a 10% Conversion Rate</h2>\n<p>The following weeks I‚Äôve been monitoring a constant stream of sales, from <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/product/rebase-book/80-sold-copies--LxpNIDxfyQV8rg0mMuX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">80</a>, <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/product/rebase-book/90-sold-copies--Ly4bUsGa67bIPeDJKSY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">90</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/product/rebase-book/100-sold-copies--LyTBPmdEKOHTIOx7cwf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">100 sold copies</a>.
